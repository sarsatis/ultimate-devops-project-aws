# Run the project Locally

In this lecture we will use the `docker compose` which is installed as part of `docker`.

Just go to the directory of cloned repo and run `docker compose up`.

Video of the lecture is self explanatory.

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/ultimate-devops-project-demo.git

2. df -h --> to check space on file system

3. go and change the volume to 30GB instead of 8

4. run lsblk (Check root project storage it might have not been still updated)

5. sudo apt install cloud-guest-utils 

6. sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1 --> just updates the file storage

7. run df -h again you will see file system is still not updated

8. sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
```
